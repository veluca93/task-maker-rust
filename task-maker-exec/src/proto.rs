//! The protocol related structs and enums.
//!
//! # Protocol Specification
//!
//! The communication between the services is done using the abstraction of
//! `std::sync::mpsc::channel`. The messages are serialized and then sent inside a `channel`. The
//! way the messages are serialized is unspecified and
//! [`serialize_into`](../../task_maker_exec/fn.serialize_into.html)/[`deserialize_from`](../../task_maker_exec/fn.deserialize_from.html)
//! should be used instead of reading from / writing to the channels.
//!
//! There are 3 basic actors in the protocol:
//!
//! - The Client: the one who makes the DAG and is interested in the results;
//! - The Server: the one who manages the execution of the DAGs;
//! - The Worker: the one who is able to run an `Execution` inside a `Sandbox`.
//!
//! The clients are able to communicate to the server, the workers are able to communicate to the
//! server and the server is able to communicate with both. The clients and the workers should not
//! communicate directly.
//!
//! The 4 valid communication directions are:
//! - `Client` — [`ExecutorClientMessage`](enum.ExecutorClientMessage.html) → `Server`
//! - `Client` ← [`ExecutorServerMessage`](enum.ExecutorServerMessage.html) — `Server`
//! - `Worker` — [`WorkerClientMessage`](enum.WorkerClientMessage.html) → `Server`
//! - `Worker` ← [`WorkerServerMessage`](enum.WorkerServerMessage.html) — `Server`
//!
//! When an actor needs a file a particular series of messages is sent. Let's assume `A` wants a
//! file from `B`:
//! - `A` sends a `AskFile` to `B`
//! - `B` answers with `ProvideFile` which triggers a protocol switch for sending the file
//! - `B` sends raw data (`send_raw`) zero or more times
//! - `B` sends empty raw data which triggers a protocol switch, back into normal mode
